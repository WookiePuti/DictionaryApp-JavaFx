# DictionaryApp-JavaFx

This project implements basic logic of a learning platform.

App has a two views, a imput view, where we are able to add words and translations and  a practise view where we are able to check corectness of answers.

Unfortunetely, the app has no connection to a database or a possibility to read a file in order to have a stable dictionary.
